									The world is a scary and big place
									<br>
									Sometimes we feel like giving up
									<br>	
									Sometimes we feel that life is not being fair
									<br>
									Most of the times we struggle and complain
									<br>
									We fail to see the beautiful things the world has to offer
									<br>
									We fail to see that each new day is an opportunity
									<br>
									An opportunity to right the wrongs of yesterday
									<br>
									An opportunity to continue move forward
									<br>
									An opportunity to hope
									<br>
									An opportunity to dream
									<br>
									An opportunity to keep on working
									<br>
									As long as we have life in us we have an opportunity to be great
									<br>
									We have an opportunity to make something great
									<br>
									Let’s stop looking for an excuse not to be great
									<br>
									Let’s start trying
									<br>
									Let’s start seeing that every new day comes with its possibilities
									<br>
									Let’s be grateful for what we have
									<br>
                                    Because there are people who have nothing
									<br>
									Let’s try to make something out of everything we have
									<br>
									The only time we truly have nothing is when we believe that we have lost all  hope
									<br>		
									The truth is; in a black and white world
									<br>
									Adaptation is  a must
									<br>
									Learning is a guarantee
									<br>
									And growth is a plus
