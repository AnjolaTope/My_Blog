                    <p>   EVERYDAY I WAKE UP
                            <br>
                            I WONDER WHAT MAKES ME DIFFERENT FROM EVERYONE ELSE
                            <br>
                            IS IT THE WAY I WALK, OR THE WAY I TALK
                            <br>
                            IS IT THE WAY I THINK OR THE WAY I PERCEIVE
                            <br>
                            I WONDER IS BEING DIFFERENT GOOD
                            <br>
                            BECAUSE SOME DAYS IT SEEMS AS IF EVERYONE IS DOING BETTER THAN ME
                            <br>
                            AND IT FEELS LIKE "ME "IS  NOT WORKING OUT   
                            <br>
                            IT FEELS LIKE I AM STUCK IN A REPEATED CYCLE OF LIFE  
                            <br>
                            WAKE UP, EXIST , SLEEP  
                            <br>
                            THEN I BEGIN TO PONDER WHY CAN'T I BE LIKE EVERYONE ELSE 
                            <br>
                            WHY CAN'T I TALK LIKE THEM,WALK LIKE THEM, SEE LIKE THEM  
                            <br>
                            AND IN THESE DAYS I BEGIN TO DROWN MYSELF IN THIS UNSOLICITED THOUGHTS 
                            <br>
                            DAYS TURN INTO MONTHS,MONTHS INTO YEARS  
                            <br>   
                            AND ALL I CAN SEE IS A BLANK SPACE FILLED WITH HORRORS AND PAIN
                            <br>
                            I COULDN'T HANDLE LIVING THIS WAY 
                            <br>                   
                            I KNEW IT WAS TIME FOR A CHANGE
                            <br> 
                            I WAS FADING IN THE LOST DREAMS OF MY IMAGINATION
                            <br>
                            SO I PICKED UP A MIRROR TO REFLECT ON THE PIECES OF MY PAST
                            <br>       
                            LOOKING AND HOPING FOR A FUTURE
                            <br>   
                            TRYING TO WAKE UP FROM THE VISION AND END THE ILLUSION THAT 
                            <br>  
                            "DIFFERENT IS BAD"
                            <br>       
                            I HAD TO SEPERATE MYSELF FROM THE TOXICITY OF PEOPLE
                            <br>       
                            I HAD TO GO ON A JOURNEY OF SELF DISCOVERY 
                            <br>    
                            TO FIND MY OWN PATH AND MY OWN RHYTHM
                            <br>        
                            I HAD TO OPEN UP MY MIND TO PULL FORTH THE HIDDEN ME
                            <br>  
                            I NEEDED TO WALK IN SOLITUDE 
                            <br> 
                            AND LIKE A BUTTERFLY I EMERGED, GRACEFULLY AND ELOQUENTLY
                            <br>   
                            THESE FEELING IS UNEXPLAINABLE
                            <br>   
                            KNOWING THAT BEING DIFFERENT DOESN'T MEAN BEING ODD
                            <br>   
                            IT MEANS STEPPING OUT
                            <br>
                            CREATING TRENDS
                            <br>         
                            DARING TO CREATE, TO INNOVATE , TO CHANGE AND TO RELATE
                            <br> 
                            IT IS BEING UNIQUE AND KNOWING THAT THERE IS BEAUTY IN HAVING STRIPES
                            <br> 
                            IT IS DARING TO HAVING COLOUR IN A MONOCHRONIC SOCIETY
                            <br>
                            FINDING NEW AIR AND CREATING NEW DYNASTIES
                            <br>
                            BEING DIFFERENT IS THE FUEL THAT POWERS DIVERSITY 
                            <br> 
                            DIVERSITY IS THE BEAUTY THROUGH WHICH THE WORLD THRIVES
                            <br>   
                            SO PLEASE DON'T HIDE YOUR "YOU" BECAUSE PEOPLE DON'T ACCEPT YOU
                            <br> 
                            BUT RATHER SHINE ON 
                            <br>
                            AND LET THEM SEE YOU GLOW FOR MILES AWAY
                            <br>
                            BE YOU AND BE PROUD
