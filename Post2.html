                    <p>   
                            Sometimes I feel alone and stressed out
                            <br>
							I feel like i am surrounded by people who don't truly understand me 
                            <br>
							People who misjudge me, people who use me
							<br>
							Buts that is life 
							<br>
							People tend to pour out their insecurities and bad energy
 							<br>
							They tend to project their insecure feelings toward the public
							<br>
							When this happens we should ignore them
							<br>
							and when they get louder we should ignore again
							<br>
							But what we should not do is use this people as a yardstick to judge the entire human race
							<br>
							Yes people can be annoying
							<br>
							Yes people can fall short of the ideals we have
							<br>
							But they are only human 
							<br>
							Like the saying goes "to err is human but to forgive is divine"
							<br>
							We should decide to be better
							<br>
							We should decide to see the light in the darkness
							<br>
							We should see their good qualities and not hold on to their bad judgement 
							<br>
							we should not judge them by one mistake
							<br>
							but we should hold on to the good memories we made together
							<br>
							Yes people have failed me, disappointed me, hurt me 
							<br>
							But I choose not to give up on people
							<br>
							Because sometimes people genuinely make mistakes
							<br>
							I choose not to let the bad attitude of someone define the way i view others
							<br>
							Because not everyone wants to use me
							<br>
							Not  everyone wants to compete with me
							<br>
							There are people who want to see me laugh
							<br>
							People who want to see me dance
							<br>
							People who pick me up when I fall
							<br>
							People who want the best for me
							<br>	
							People who want to grow with me
							<br>
							Ride with me 
							<br>
							And people who will die for me
							<br>
							The truth is that not everyone will fit into our status quo of a perfect person
							<br>
							But we make due with what we've got and see the light in people
